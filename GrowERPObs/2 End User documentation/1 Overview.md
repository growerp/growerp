# Functional System overview

This purpose of this system is to run a company from a single person to about 100 employees.

Running a company can be split by specific job functions:

- First of all the company has to be promoted so people know it exists, and the products or services it is selling. That is done by the [[4 Marketing & sales]] functions
- When the company is known by its target audience, there should be a possibility to order its products or services either by an E-commerce site, social media, email or telephone. Incoming orders are handled by the [[5 Order management]] function
- When physical product orders do come in they need to be packed and shipped by the [[6 Inventory management]] function.
- In order to make sure financial records are recorded when they happen in the operational functions then [[7 Accounting]] will automatically generate invoices and payments from the incoming order and will be posted into the ledger.

### In short, how to process an incoming sales order?

1. Approve on the sales order list.
2. Pack and confirm on the outgoing shipment list.

### Result

full record of the product -> order -> shipment -> invoice/payment -> accounting ledger
