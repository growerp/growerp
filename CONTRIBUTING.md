## Development Setup

### Frontend Development

1. **Install Flutter** (version 3.2.6 or higher)
2. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/growerp/growerp.git
   cd growerp
   ```

3. **Set up Flutter packages**:
   ```bash
   cd flutter
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Run the admin application**:
   ```bash
   cd packages/admin
   flutter run
   ```

For detailed frontend development, see the [Building Blocks Development Guide](docs/Building_Blocks_Development_Guide.md).

### Backend Development

1. **Install Java** (version 11 or higher)
2. **Install Gradle** (version 7.0 or higher)
3. **Set up the backend**:
   ```bash
   cd moqui
   ./gradlew run
   ```

For detailed backend development, see the [Backend Components Development Guide](docs/Backend_Components_Development_Guide.md).

### Full Stack Development

For complete application development:
1. Start the backend server
2. Configure the Flutter app to connect to your local backend
3. Run the Flutter application

## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/growerp.git
cd growerp
```

### 2. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
# Create a new branch from the development branch
git checkout development
git checkout -b my-new-feature
```

### 3. Make Your Changes

- Follow our [coding standards](#coding-standards)
- Write tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Test your changes thoroughly

### 4. Commit Your Changes
