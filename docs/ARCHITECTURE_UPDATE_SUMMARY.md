# Major Architecture Update Summary

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Scope:** Product-Agnostic & Modular Package Architecture

---

## What Changed

### 1. Two New Packages Instead of One

#### Before
```
configurable_pages/
├─ assessment + page + lead logic mixed
└─ Can't be reused
```

#### After
```
growerp_assessment/        (Reusable Building Block)
├─ Assessment logic only
└─ Can be used in any app

landing_page/              (Public App)
├─ Landing page + lead capture
└─ Uses growerp_assessment package
```

### 2. Product-Agnostic Language

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "survey" (ERP-specific) | "assessment" (generic) |
| "qualification scoring" | "dynamic scoring" |
| "sales funnel" | "lead qualification workflow" |
| Hard-coded CTA types | Configurable next-step types |

### 3. Dual-ID Strategy (Enhanced)

| Field | System-Wide Unique | Tenant-Unique | User-Facing? |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Primary Key | assessmentId | - | ❌ Internal |
| Pseudo ID | - | pseudoId | ✅ URLs, Admin, API |

**Benefits:**
- ✅ User-friendly URLs: `/landingPage/page_product_readiness`
- ✅ Admin displays meaningful IDs
- ✅ Secure: Frontend never sees system IDs
- ✅ Scalable: System IDs efficient for DB relationships

## Updated Documentation

### New Document
**File:** `GROWERP_ASSESSMENT_AND_LANDING_PAGE_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Comprehensive package architecture explanation
- Data flow diagrams
- Integration patterns
- Success metrics

### Updated Documents

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** | Part 2: Separated assessment package from landing page app; Part 3: Split backend services; Part 4: Menu-based admin integration; Part 7: Reorganized entity tables by package |
| **Part 2: Frontend** | Now 3 separate sections: growerp_assessment, landing_page app, admin integration |
| **Part 3: Backend** | Split into Assessment Services + Landing Page Services + Entities |
| **Part 4: Admin** | Menu-based structure using growerp_assessment for assessment config |
| **Part 5: Phases** | Phase 1 focuses on growerp_assessment package; Phase 2 implements landing_page app |
| **Part 7: Database** | Entity tables reorganized by package ownership |

## Package Hierarchy (GrowERP Pattern)

```
growerp_models (Lowest dependency)
    ↓
growerp_core (Shared UI/Auth/State)
    ↓
growerp_assessment (NEW - Building Block)
    │   └─ Can be used standalone
    │   └─ Reusable in any app needing surveys
    │
    ├→ growerp_marketing (Existing)
    │
    └→ landing_page (NEW - Public App)
        └─ Depends on: core, models, assessment, marketing
        └─ Specific to: public landing page + lead capture
        │
        └→ admin (Existing - Extended)
            └─ Manages: landing pages + assessments + results
```

### Why This Structure

1. **growerp_assessment Reusability**
   - Can be imported by marketing app for customer feedback
   - Can be imported by support app for customer health checks
   - Can be imported by HR app for employee surveys
   - Product-agnostic scoring and thresholds

2. **landing_page App Clarity**
   - Only handles landing page content (hero, sections, credibility, CTA)
   - Lead capture logic clean and focused
   - Uses Assessment from package for survey flow

3. **Admin Integration Consistency**
   - Follows GrowERP menu pattern
   - Menu item for Landing Pages submenu for Assessment config
   - Results dashboard consolidated

## Key Benefits of New Architecture

| Aspect | Benefit |

| **Maintainability** | Smaller, focused packages easier to test and update |
| **Clarity** | Each package has single responsibility |
| **Extensibility** | Easy to extend assessment or landing page independently |
| **Future-Ready** | growerp_assessment version can be published independently |
| **Multi-Tenant** | Dual-ID strategy makes multi-tenant queries simple |
| **Product-Agnostic** | Not tied to ERP/sales; works for any survey use case |
| **Admin Consistency** | Menu-based UI follows GrowERP patterns |

---

## Dual-ID Implementation Details

### How It Works

**growerp_assessment Service Example:**
```dart
// Service accepts either ID
Future<Assessment> getAssessment(String assessmentIdOrPseudoId) async {
  // Try direct lookup first (fastest)
  if (isUuid(assessmentIdOrPseudoId)) {
    return await backendService.getByAssessmentId(assessmentIdOrPseudoId);
  }
  
  // Fall back to pseudoId lookup (with tenant context)
  return await backendService.getByPseudoId(
    assessmentIdOrPseudoId, 
    companyPartyId,
  );
}
```

**Backend Service Example:**
```xml
<service verb="get" noun="Assessment">
  <in-parameters>
    <parameter name="assessmentId" type="String"/>      <!-- system-wide unique -->
    <parameter name="pseudoId" type="String"/>          <!-- tenant-unique -->
  </in-parameters>
  <out-parameters>
    <parameter name="assessment" type="Map"/>
  </out-parameters>
</service>
```

**Moqui Service Logic:**
```groovy
// Try assessmentId first (exact match, fastest)
if (assessmentId) {
  entity = run service:"growerp.EntityServices.getEntity" {
    entityName = "Assessment"
    entityId = assessmentId
  }
} else {
  // Use pseudoId with tenant context
  entity = from("Assessment")
    .where(pseudoId: pseudoId, companyPartyId: companyPartyId)
    .selectOne()
}
```

### Multi-Tenant Isolation

**Every Query Includes:**
```sql
WHERE companyPartyId = ? AND (assessmentId = ? OR pseudoId = ?)
```

**pseudoId Uniqueness:**
```sql
UNIQUE INDEX idx_assessment_pseudoid ON assessment(companyPartyId, pseudoId)
```

**Result:** Same pseudoId can exist in different tenants, but not within same tenant

---

## Breaking Changes (None!)

✅ **Backward Compatible:**
- Existing APIs continue to work
- New packages are additive
- Admin module extended, not replaced
- Database schema fully compatible

---

## Migration Path

**For Developers Using Old Spec:**
1. Read: GROWERP_ASSESSMENT_AND_LANDING_PAGE_ARCHITECTURE.md
2. Note: Two packages now instead of one
3. Implement: growerp_assessment first (reusable)
4. Then: landing_page app (uses assessment)
5. Finally: Admin integration

**For Existing Code:**
- If created "configurable_pages" - refactor into growerp_assessment + landing_page
- Extract assessment logic → growerp_assessment
- Keep page/lead logic → landing_page
