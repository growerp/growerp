## Phase 1 Day-by-Day Breakdown

### Week 1: Backend & Models

#### **Days 1-2: Backend Entity Setup**

**Morning (Day 1):**
```
1. Create Moqui component directory structure:
   moqui/runtime/component/growerp/entity/
   moqui/runtime/component/growerp/service/
   moqui/runtime/component/growerp/screen/

2. Create entity definition files:
   - AssessmentEntities.xml (Assessment, AssessmentQuestion, 
     AssessmentQuestionOption, ScoringThreshold)
   - ResultEntities.xml (AssessmentResult)

3. Define entities with required fields:
   - All have: [entityName]Id (system-wide unique primary key)
   - All have: pseudoId (user-facing tenant-unique alternative)
   - All have: ownerPartyId (multi-tenant isolation)
   - All have: createdByUserLogin, createdDate, lastModifiedByUserLogin, lastModifiedDate
```

**Entities to Create:**

```xml
<!-- Assessment -->
assessmentId (PK), pseudoId (unique), ownerPartyId (FK), 
assessmentName, description, status, createdDate

<!-- AssessmentQuestion -->
questionId (PK), pseudoId (unique), assessmentId (FK),
questionSequence, questionType, questionText, questionDescription

<!-- AssessmentQuestionOption -->
optionId (PK), pseudoId (unique), questionId (FK),
optionSequence, optionText, optionScore

<!-- ScoringThreshold -->
thresholdId (PK), pseudoId (unique), assessmentId (FK),
minScore, maxScore, leadStatus (Cold/Warm/Hot)

<!-- AssessmentResult -->
resultId (PK), pseudoId (unique), assessmentId (FK), ownerPartyId (FK),
score, leadStatus, capturedLeadId, createdDate, resultData (JSON)
```

**Afternoon (Day 1):**
```
4. Create database relationships:
   - Assessment 1:N AssessmentQuestion
   - AssessmentQuestion 1:N AssessmentQuestionOption
   - Assessment 1:N ScoringThreshold
   - Assessment 1:N AssessmentResult

5. Create indices for performance:
   - INDEX ON (ownerPartyId, assessmentId)
   - INDEX ON (pseudoId) for fast lookups
   - INDEX ON (createdDate) for sorting
```

**Verification (End of Day 1):**
- [ ] All 5 entity files created
- [ ] All relationships defined
- [ ] Database schema verified
- [ ] Can generate database from entities

**Day 2:**
```
6. Verify in database:
   - Create dev database from entities
   - Check all tables created
   - Check all indices created
   - Check relationships correct

7. Create sample test data:
   - 1 Assessment with pseudoId
   - 3 Questions
   - 9 Options (3 per question)
   - 3 Thresholds (Cold/Warm/Hot)
   - 5 Results (mixed scores)

8. Test database queries:
   - Query by assessmentId (system key)
   - Query by pseudoId (user-facing key)
   - Join Assessment â†’ Questions â†’ Options
   - Verify multi-tenant filtering (ownerPartyId)
```

**Verification (End of Day 2):**
- [ ] All sample data created
- [ ] Query by assessmentId works
- [ ] Query by pseudoId works
- [ ] Multi-tenant filtering works

---

#### **Day 3: Backend Services**

**Morning:**
```
1. Create AssessmentServices.xml with 6 services:
   
   getAssessment(assessmentId or pseudoId, ownerPartyId)
   â”œâ”€ Accepts: assessmentId OR pseudoId
   â”œâ”€ Filters: WHERE ownerPartyId = ?
   â””â”€ Returns: Assessment + Questions + Options + Thresholds
   
   listAssessments(ownerPartyId, pageNumber, pageSize)
   â”œâ”€ Returns: List of Assessments for tenant
   â”œâ”€ Includes: Question count, recent results count
   â””â”€ Paging: 20 per page default
   
   createAssessment(assessmentName, description, ownerPartyId, questions)
   â”œâ”€ Generate pseudoId (unique per tenant)
   â”œâ”€ Create Assessment entity
   â”œâ”€ Create Questions entities
   â”œâ”€ Generate assessmentId (system-wide unique)
   â””â”€ Returns: New Assessment with all IDs
   
   updateAssessment(assessmentId, assessmentName, description, questions)
   â”œâ”€ Update Assessment entity
   â”œâ”€ Update/insert/delete Questions as needed
   â”œâ”€ Preserve all IDs
   â””â”€ Returns: Updated Assessment
   
   deleteAssessment(assessmentId)
   â”œâ”€ Soft delete or hard delete with cascading
   â”œâ”€ Decide: Delete results too? (probably keep them)
   â””â”€ Returns: Success/failure
   
   submitAssessment(assessmentId, leadInfo, answers)
   â”œâ”€ Validate all answers
   â”œâ”€ Calculate score
   â”œâ”€ Create AssessmentResult
   â”œâ”€ Extract lead info from Step 1
   â””â”€ Returns: Result with score and status
```

**Afternoon:**
```
2. Create ScoringServices.xml:
   
   calculateScore(assessmentId, answers)
   â”œâ”€ Load assessment questions
   â”œâ”€ Load scoring thresholds
   â”œâ”€ Calculate: sum(answer_score * question_weight)
   â”œâ”€ Normalize to 0-100 scale
   â””â”€ Returns: Score (0-100)
   
   getThresholds(assessmentId)
   â”œâ”€ Query ScoringThreshold table
   â”œâ”€ Returns: [{minScore, maxScore, leadStatus}, ...]
   â””â”€ Used by admin to configure scoring
   
   updateThresholds(assessmentId, thresholds)
   â”œâ”€ Update ScoringThreshold records
   â”œâ”€ Validate no overlaps
   â”œâ”€ Validate total coverage 0-100
   â””â”€ Returns: Updated thresholds

3. Implement dual-ID lookup in all services:
   - If parameter starts with "pseudo_": lookup by pseudoId
   - Else: lookup by assessmentId (system key)
   - Always filter by ownerPartyId (multi-tenant)

4. Implement error handling:
   - Assessment not found â†’ return 404
   - Insufficient permissions (ownerPartyId mismatch) â†’ return 403
   - Invalid data â†’ return 400 with details
   - Server error â†’ return 500 with logging
```

- [ ] All 3 scoring services created
- [ ] All services accept both ID types
- [ ] Multi-tenant filtering enforced
- [ ] Error handling complete
- [ ] Can call services via REST API

       Emitter<AssessmentState> emit,
     ) async {
       emit(AssessmentLoading());
       try {
         final assessment = await _service.getAssessment(event.idOrPseudoId);
         emit(AssessmentLoaded(assessment));
       } on DioException catch (e) {

       List<int> answers,
       String name,
       String email,
       String phone,
     ) async {
       // Validate answers
       // Create submission object
       // Call backend API
       // Return result
     }
   }

5. Add caching strategy:
   - Cache assessment for 5 minutes
   - Invalidate on create/update/delete
   - Use BlocProvider for global state

6. Create BLoC unit tests:
   
   test('FetchAssessmentEvent emits AssessmentLoaded', () {
     final assessment = Assessment(...);
     when(mockService.getAssessment(any))
       .thenAnswer((_) async => assessment);
     
     expect(
       assessmentBloc.stream,
       emitsInOrder([
         isA<AssessmentLoading>(),
         isA<AssessmentLoaded>(),
       ]),
     );
     
     assessmentBloc.add(FetchAssessmentEvent('123'));
   });
   
   test('Error emits AssessmentError', () {
     when(mockService.getAssessment(any))
       .thenThrow(DioException(...));
     
     expect(
       assessmentBloc.stream,
       emitsInOrder([
         isA<AssessmentLoading>(),
         isA<AssessmentError>(),
       ]),
     );
     
     assessmentBloc.add(FetchAssessmentEvent('invalid'));
   });
```

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues & Solutions:**

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Moqui build fails | Run `./gradlew clean build` in moqui/ directory |
| Flutter models don't serialize | Run `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` |
| BLoC tests fail | Check mock service is returning correct types |
| Multi-tenant test fails | Verify all queries filter by `ownerPartyId` |
| Performance slow | Add database indices, check for N+1 queries |
| CI/CD tests fail | Check all dependencies installed, run locally first |
