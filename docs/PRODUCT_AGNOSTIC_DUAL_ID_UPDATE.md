# Product-Agnostic & Dual-ID Strategy Update

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Impact:** All 7 documentation files updated

---

## 🎯 Changes Made

### 1. Product-Agnostic Transformation

**Previous Approach:** ERP-focused with specific terminology
- "Landing Page" → "Configurable Page" (or "Page")
- "Assessment" → "Survey" (or "Qualification Survey")
- "Best Practices Questions" → "Survey Questions"
- ERP-specific language removed

**New Approach:** Universal, works for ANY product type

#### Renamed Entities:
| Old Name | New Name | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| LandingPage | Page | Configurable page content |
| Assessment | Survey | Survey/questionnaire configuration |
| AssessmentQuestion | SurveyQuestion | Individual survey questions |
| AssessmentResult | QualificationResult | Submitted survey results |
| AssessmentLead | SurveyLead | Lead from survey result |

#### Renamed Services:
| Old Name | New Name | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| LandingPageService | PageService | Page management |
| AssessmentScoringService | SurveyScoringService | Scoring logic |
| LandingPageServices.xml | PageServices.xml | Moqui backend services |
| AssessmentServices.xml | SurveyServices.xml | Moqui backend services |

#### Use Cases Now Enabled:
✅ ERP & Business Software Readiness Assessments  
✅ Consulting Service Qualifications  
✅ Training & Skill Assessments  
✅ Healthcare Patient Intake Forms  
✅ Financial Risk Assessment  
✅ Real Estate Buyer/Seller Qualification  
✅ E-commerce Product Recommendation  
✅ Nonprofit Beneficiary Qualification  
✅ Any Type of Lead Qualification Survey

### 2. Dual-ID Strategy Implementation

**Problem Solved:** Backend systems need globally unique IDs, users need readable IDs

**Solution:** Every entity has TWO IDs

#### ID Naming Convention

```
Primary Key (System ID):          {entityName}Id (lowercase start)
├─ Example: pageId, surveyId, questionId, resultId, leadId
├─ Scope: System-wide unique (auto-generated)
├─ Use: Backend operations, relationships, internal logic
└─ Exposure: Never shown to frontend users

User-Facing ID (Pseudo ID):       pseudoId
├─ Example: page_product_readiness, survey_q1_2025
├─ Scope: Tenant-unique (user-provided or auto-generated)
├─ Use: URLs, admin UI, user-facing queries
└─ Exposure: Always shown to users
```

#### All 11 Entities Now Have Dual IDs:

| Entity | System ID | Pseudo ID | Tenant-Unique? |
|--------|-----------|-----------|---|
| Page | pageId | pseudoId | Yes |
| PageSection | sectionId | pseudoId | Yes |
| CredibilityInfo | credibilityId | pseudoId | Yes |
| CredibilityStatistic | statisticId | pseudoId | Yes |
| PrimaryCTA | ctaId | pseudoId | Yes |
| Survey | surveyId | pseudoId | Yes |
| SurveyQuestion | questionId | pseudoId | Yes |
| SurveyQuestionOption | optionId | pseudoId | Yes |
| ScoringThreshold | thresholdId | pseudoId | Yes |
| QualificationResult | resultId | pseudoId | Yes |
| SurveyLead | leadId | pseudoId | Yes |

#### Dual-ID Architecture Diagram

```
Frontend (User-Facing)
  ↓
  URLs: /page/page_product_readiness
  Admin UI: Display pseudoId everywhere
  ↓
API Layer (Supports Both)
  ↓
  GET /api/v1/page/page_product_readiness
  OR
  GET /api/v1/page/p_page_20251023_001
  ↓
Service Layer (Handles Lookup)
  ↓
  Try exact match first
  If UUID format → query by pageId
  If non-UUID → query by pseudoId
  ↓
Backend (System-Wide Unique)
  ↓
  Database relationships use pageId
  Foreign keys use pageId
  Queries return both IDs
  ↓
Return to Frontend (Both IDs)
  ↓
  {
    "pageId": "p_page_20251023_001",
    "pseudoId": "page_product_readiness",
    ...
  }
```

## 🔑 Key Features of Dual-ID Strategy

### 1. **Backend Safety**
```
✅ System IDs (pageId) are system-wide unique
✅ No possibility of accidental cross-tenant access
✅ Foreign key relationships use system IDs
✅ Database queries efficient with indexed system IDs
```

### 2. **User-Friendly Frontend**
```
✅ URLs are readable: /page/product_readiness_assessment
✅ Admin UI shows meaningful pseudo IDs
✅ Users never see system IDs (UUIDs, sequences)
✅ Tenant scoping is transparent
```

### 3. **Flexible API**
```
✅ Backend can accept either ID type
✅ Services handle lookup transparently
✅ Developers choose what's convenient
✅ No breaking changes to API
```

### 4. **Multi-Tenant Isolation**
```
✅ pseudoId uniqueness enforced per tenant
✅ Query filters by companyPartyId
✅ System ID global uniqueness prevents collisions
✅ No data leakage between tenants
```

## 📊 Schema Changes Summary

### Entities Created:
```
OLD: 12 entities (some with only pseudoId)
NEW: 11 entities (all with both pageId + pseudoId)

Entity Mapping:
LandingPage → Page (pageId + pseudoId)
ValueArea → PageSection (sectionId + pseudoId)
Assessment → Survey (surveyId + pseudoId)
AssessmentQuestion → SurveyQuestion (questionId + pseudoId)
AssessmentQuestionOption → SurveyQuestionOption (optionId + pseudoId)
AssessmentResult → QualificationResult (resultId + pseudoId)
AssessmentLead → SurveyLead (leadId + pseudoId)
... (plus utility entities with dual IDs)
```

### Naming Pattern for IDs

**System IDs (Backend):**
- Format: `{lowercase_entity_name}Id`
- Examples: `pageId`, `surveyId`, `questionId`, `resultId`, `leadId`
- Generated by: Backend (auto-increment or UUID)
- Visibility: Internal only

**Pseudo IDs (User-Facing):**
- Format: Descriptive human-readable strings
- Examples: `page_product_readiness`, `survey_q1_2025`, `result_john_smith_oct23`
- Generated by: User input or auto-generated from context
- Visibility: Always exposed

## 📞 Quick Reference

### Entity ID Format
```
pageId:       p_page_20251023_001    (system-wide unique)
pseudoId:     page_product_readiness (tenant-unique, user-facing)

surveyId:     s_survey_20251023_001
pseudoId:     survey_product_q2025

resultId:     r_result_20251023_001
pseudoId:     result_john_doe_oct23
```

### API Usage
```
// Both work
GET /api/v1/page/p_page_20251023_001
GET /api/v1/page/page_product_readiness

// Service handles lookup
if (UUID format) → find by pageId
else → find by pseudoId (within tenant)
```

### Database Queries
```sql
-- Using system ID (fast, global scope)
SELECT * FROM Page WHERE pageId = 'p_page_20251023_001'

-- Using pseudo ID (user-facing, tenant scope)
SELECT * FROM Page 
WHERE pseudoId = 'page_product_readiness' 
  AND companyPartyId = 'comp_acme'
```
