## 🔐 Dual-ID Strategy Summary

### How It Works

**Every Backend Entity Has:**
```
Primary Key:  {entityName}Id      (assessmentId, pageId, leadId)
              System-wide unique
              Internal use only
              Used in relationships

Unique Index: pseudoId
              Tenant-unique
              User-facing (URLs, admin, API)
              Human-readable format
```

### Benefits

| Benefit | How It Works |
|---------|------------|
| **User-Friendly** | URLs show: `/landingPage/page_product_readiness` |
| **Secure** | Frontend never sees system IDs |
| **Scalable** | System IDs efficient for DB relationships |
| **Flexible** | Both ID types work in queries |
| **Multi-Tenant** | pseudoId unique per tenant, not globally |

### Implemented For All Entities

✅ Assessment + AssessmentQuestion + AssessmentQuestionOption  
✅ ScoringThreshold + AssessmentResult  
✅ LandingPage + PageSection + CredibilityInfo + CredibilityStatistic + PrimaryCTA  
✅ AssessmentLead  

**Total:** 11 entities with dual-ID strategy
