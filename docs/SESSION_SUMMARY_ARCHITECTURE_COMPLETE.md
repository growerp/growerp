## üéØ Accomplishments This Session

### ‚úÖ 1. Product-Agnostic Design Implemented
- Removed all ERP/sales-specific language
- Generic terminology throughout (assessment, lead, survey, etc.)

- Both IDs work in all backend queries
- URLs use pseudoIds only

### ‚úÖ 3. Modular Package Architecture Created
- **growerp_assessment** - Reusable building block (NEW)
- **landing_page** - Public app using assessment (NEW)
- **admin** - Extended with landing page management (UPDATED)
- Follows GrowERP package dependency patterns

### ‚úÖ 4. Comprehensive Documentation Updated
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md completely restructured (7 parts)
- New architecture guide created (GROWERP_ASSESSMENT_...)
- Update summary document created (ARCHITECTURE_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md)
- All 9 documentation files verified and consistent

## üîê Dual-ID Strategy Summary

### How It Works

**Every Backend Entity Has:**
```
Primary Key:  {entityName}Id      (assessmentId, pageId, leadId)
              System-wide unique
              Internal use only
              Used in relationships

Unique Index: pseudoId
              Tenant-unique
              User-facing (URLs, admin, API)
              Human-readable format
```

### Benefits

| Benefit | How It Works |
|---------|------------|
| **User-Friendly** | URLs show: `/landingPage/page_product_readiness` |
| **Secure** | Frontend never sees system IDs |
| **Scalable** | System IDs efficient for DB relationships |
| **Flexible** | Both ID types work in queries |
| **Multi-Tenant** | pseudoId unique per tenant, not globally |

### Implemented For All Entities

‚úÖ Assessment + AssessmentQuestion + AssessmentQuestionOption  
‚úÖ ScoringThreshold + AssessmentResult  
‚úÖ LandingPage + PageSection + CredibilityInfo + CredibilityStatistic + PrimaryCTA  
‚úÖ AssessmentLead  

**Total:** 11 entities with dual-ID strategy
