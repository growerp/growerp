## Key Concepts

### Frontend Extensibility

- **Building Blocks**: Reusable Flutter packages that encapsulate specific business functionality
- **Menu System**: Configurable navigation with role-based access control
- **Templates**: Consistent UI patterns and responsive layouts
- **Applications**: Composed by combining building blocks and configuring menus

### Backend Extensibility

- **Components**: Self-contained Moqui modules that extend backend functionality
- **Entities**: Data model definitions with relationships and constraints
- **Services**: Business logic with validation, transactions, and error handling
- **APIs**: REST endpoints with automatic JSON serialization and authentication

### AI Integration

- **MCP Server**: Model Context Protocol server for AI-powered business automation
- **Business Tools**: 25+ integrated business operations accessible to AI agents
- **Authentication**: Secure API key-based access with user classification
- **Multi-language Support**: Client examples in Python, Node.js, JavaScript, and more

### Integration Patterns

- **State Management**: BLoC pattern for consistent frontend state management
- **API Communication**: Standardized REST API patterns with error handling
- **AI Integration**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for AI-powered business automation
