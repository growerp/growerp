## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **Phase 1 Late** | Blocks all other phases | Start immediately, daily standup |
| **Moqui Complexity** | Backend work delayed | Have expert available, pair programming |
| **Performance Issues** | Production delays | Load test early, optimize incrementally |
| **Security Issues** | Launch delayed | Security audit in Phase 5, not at end |
| **Data Loss** | Critical incident | Backup strategy from Phase 4, test regularly |
| **Multi-tenant Bug** | Data leakage | Extra testing in Phase 4, pen test |
| **Frontend/Backend Mismatch** | Integration issues | Daily communication, agreed APIs early |
| **Scope Creep** | Schedule delays | Strict Phase 2 gate, defer enhancements |

### How to Mitigate

1. **Daily Standups:** 15 min, report blockers immediately
2. **Weekly Architecture Reviews:** Verify designs early
3. **Continuous Testing:** Test as you go, not at the end
4. **Code Reviews:** Every PR reviewed by 2 people
5. **Security First:** Threat model in Phase 1, don't bolt on later
6. **Performance Benchmarks:** Establish targets in Phase 1
7. **Communication:** Frontend/Backend sync daily
8. **Documentation:** Write as you go, not at the end
