# Landing Page App - Removed Example Directory

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Change:** Remove `example/` directory from landing_page app (it's an app, not a building block)  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Document Updated:** LANDING_PAGE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

---

## Summary

The landing_page app no longer has an `example/` directory in its structure, because it is an **app** (like admin, hotel, support, freelance, health), not a **building block package** (like growerp_assessment, growerp_core, growerp_models).

### Package vs App Distinction

| Type | Has Example? | Location | Purpose |
|------|-------------|----------|---------|
| **Building Block Package** | ✅ YES | `flutter/packages/growerp_*` | Reusable component for multiple apps |
| **App** | ❌ NO | `flutter/packages/{admin,hotel,support,landing_page,...}` | End-user application |

## Changes Made

### 1. Landing Page App Structure (Part 2.2)

**BEFORE:**
```
landing_page/
├── lib/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── models/
│   │   ├── services/
│   │   ├── bloc/
│   │   ├── screens/
│   │   ├── widgets/
│   │   ├── constants/
│   │   └── utils/
│   ├── landing_page.dart
│   └── get_landing_page_bloc_providers.dart
├── example/                           ← REMOVED
│   ├── integration_test/
│   │   └── landing_page_test.dart
│   └── lib/main.dart
├── pubspec.yaml
├── README.md
└── CHANGELOG.md
```

**AFTER:**
```
landing_page/
├── lib/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── models/
│   │   ├── services/
│   │   ├── bloc/
│   │   ├── screens/
│   │   ├── widgets/
│   │   ├── constants/
│   │   └── utils/
│   ├── landing_page.dart
│   └── get_landing_page_bloc_providers.dart
├── pubspec.yaml
├── README.md
└── CHANGELOG.md
```

### 2. Frontend Files List (Part 6)

**BEFORE:**
```
flutter/packages/landing_page/
├── lib/src/models/...
├── lib/src/services/...
├── lib/src/bloc/...
├── lib/src/screens/...
├── lib/src/widgets/...
├── lib/src/constants/...
├── lib/src/utils/...
├── lib/landing_page.dart
├── lib/get_landing_page_bloc_providers.dart
├── pubspec.yaml
├── README.md
├── CHANGELOG.md
├── example/lib/main.dart                ← REMOVED
└── example/integration_test/landing_page_test.dart  ← REMOVED
```

**AFTER:**
```
flutter/packages/landing_page/
├── lib/src/models/...
├── lib/src/services/...
├── lib/src/bloc/...
├── lib/src/screens/...
├── lib/src/widgets/...
├── lib/src/constants/...
├── lib/src/utils/...
├── lib/landing_page.dart
├── lib/get_landing_page_bloc_providers.dart
├── pubspec.yaml
├── README.md
└── CHANGELOG.md
```

---

## What This Means

### ✅ Testing Still Happens

Testing for the landing_page app will be handled:

1. **Unit Tests:** In the app's `test/` directory (standard Flutter practice)
2. **Integration Tests:** In the admin package or via end-to-end testing
3. **No Example App:** The app IS the main application

### ✅ growerp_assessment Still Has Example

The **growerp_assessment** building block package **does retain** its example directory because:

- It's a reusable component
- Developers need to see how to use it in their own apps
- Example provides reference implementation
- Standard pattern for building block packages

```
growerp_assessment/
├── lib/...
├── example/                           ← KEPT
│   ├── integration_test/
│   │   └── assessment_test.dart
│   └── lib/main.dart
├── pubspec.yaml
├── README.md
└── CHANGELOG.md
```

### ✅ Consistency with GrowERP Apps

This aligns with how other GrowERP apps are structured:

```
App Packages (No Example):
- flutter/packages/admin/          ← No example/
- flutter/packages/hotel/          ← No example/
- flutter/packages/support/        ← No example/
- flutter/packages/freelance/      ← No example/
- flutter/packages/health/         ← No example/
- flutter/packages/landing_page/   ← No example/ (NOW)

Building Block Packages (With Example):
- flutter/packages/growerp_core/        ← Has example/
- flutter/packages/growerp_models/      ← Has example/
- flutter/packages/growerp_assessment/  ← Has example/
- flutter/packages/growerp_user_company/ ← Has example/
- flutter/packages/growerp_catalog/     ← Has example/
```

---

## Structure Summary

### Before Changes
- ❌ landing_page app had unnecessary example directory
- ❌ Inconsistent with other apps (admin, hotel, etc.)
- ❌ Confusing distinction between app and package

### After Changes
- ✅ landing_page app structure matches admin/hotel/support/etc.
- ✅ Clear distinction: apps have no example, packages have example
- ✅ Cleaner, simpler structure
- ✅ Tests happen in standard locations (test/, not example/)

---

## Impact

### ✅ Benefits

1. **Consistency:** Landing_page app now matches GrowERP app pattern
2. **Clarity:** Easy to distinguish apps from building block packages
3. **Simplicity:** No unnecessary example infrastructure
4. **Standard:** Follows Flutter/Dart conventions for apps vs packages

### ✅ No Breaking Changes

- No functionality affected
- No behavior changes
- Documentation update only
- Code structure aligns with best practices

---

## Next Steps for Phase 2 Implementation

When creating the landing_page app:

1. **Create app structure** WITHOUT example/ directory
2. **Add tests** in standard locations:
   - Unit tests: `test/unit/...`
   - Widget tests: `test/widget/...`
   - Integration tests: Via melos test coordination with admin package
3. **Reference growerp_assessment** as dependency (which HAS example for developers)
4. **Follow existing app patterns** (admin package as template)

---

**Document Status:** READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION ✅

All documentation updated. Landing_page app structure now consistent with GrowERP app conventions (no example directory).
