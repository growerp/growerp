===========================================================================

Mantle Universal Data Model 1.1.0 is a minor new feature release. This
release is based on Moqui Framework 2.0.0.

The changes in this release are generally minor refinements and cleanups
plus improvements for agreements, work types, employment, and budgets and
expense management.

Non Backward Compatible Changes

- Agreement fromPartyId, fromRoleTypeId, toPartyId, toRoleTypeId fields
  replaced with organization and other (instead of from/to); the Agreement
  entities are not generally used, but any existing data/code would
  need to be moved/updated
- Changed FacilityContent, RequestContent, ProductCategoryContent,
  and ProductConfigItemContent to use a single PK field like other content
  entities; these entities are not currently used in services, etc but if
  used in custom code the code and existing data will need to be updated
- EmplPosition.exemptFlag replaced by taxExemptEnumId and taxFormId

New Features

- Set many entities to cache=never to avoid overhead of caching where
  read/write ratio doesn't justify it or where cache could cause issues
- Agreement and Term improvements
  - Refined TermType enums
  - Parties on Agreement are now organization and other instead of from/to
  - Added AgreementTerm termText and termNumber fields
  - New Settlement types for day of current or next month
- Added Enumeration type WorkType and workTypeEnumId to RateAmount,
  TimeEntry, WorkEffortParty, and replaced emplPositionClassId on
  WorkEffort work workTypeEnumId; this is useful for defining work types
  separate from position classes for a generally cleaner model and to
  better represent how position classes can have many work types
- Employment Tax Settings
  - Added Employment.taxFormId to override EmplPosition.taxFormId
  - Added PayrollAdjustmentExempt entity to configure exemptions based on
    EmplPosition.taxExemptEnumId
- Added InvoiceItemDetail to allocate expenses to Assets, Facilities, etc
- Expanded Budget and related entities to handle common budgeting scenarios
  such as a budget that parallels GL expense accounts and budgets for
  Assets and Facilities, and for budgets with a longer time period such as
  a year with sub-periods such as months within the year
