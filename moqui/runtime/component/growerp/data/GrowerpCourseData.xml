        <content><![CDATA[## The Three-Package Growth Model

Every paying customer passes through three stages. GrowERP maps each stage to a dedicated package so your team always knows where a lead is and what to do next.

### Top of Funnel (ToFu) - growerp_marketing
The marketing package is responsible for making strangers aware of your offer and capturing their contact details. It provides:
- **Personas** - define the ideal customer profiles you are targeting
- **Landing Pages** - public-facing pages with a value proposition and call-to-action
- **Assessments** - interactive questionnaires that qualify a lead while delivering value
- **Content Plans and Social Posts** - coordinate the content that drives traffic to your landing pages

A visitor who enters his email on the landingpage or completes an assessment becomes a *lead* in the system with a score and a persona tag.

### Middle of Funnel (MoFu) - growerp_outreach
The outreach package takes over once a lead exists. It automates the follow-up communication across multiple channels until the lead is warm enough for a direct sales conversation. It provides:
- **Platform Configurations** - connect your email account, LinkedIn profile, or other channels
- **Campaigns** - groups of leads targeted by a specific message strategy
- **Message Sequences** - step-by-step timed messages sent automatically
- **Automation Service** - background service that executes sequences without manual effort

### Bottom of Funnel (BoFu) - growerp_sales
The sales package manages each high-value deal from first contact to signed order. It provides:
- **Opportunities** - a record for each deal with its own pipeline stage, estimated value, and assigned rep
- **Stage Progression** - move a deal from Prospecting through Qualification, Proposal, Quote, and on to Closed Won or Closed Lost
- **Convert to Quote** - one-click creation of a sales order in preparation status, linked back to the opportunity

### The Data Flow — Two Entry Points

**Warm-lead track (inbound):**
A visitor completes a landing page assessment in Marketing → becomes a lead → is enrolled in an Outreach campaign → receives automated messages → when engaged, a rep creates an Opportunity in Sales → pipeline progresses to Quote → Convert to Quote creates a sales order.

**Cold-lead track (outbound):**
The Outreach scraping service discovers prospects from external sources → creates OutreachMessages in PENDING status → a rep contacts them (CONTACTED) → prospect replies (RESPONDED) → rep taps Convert to Lead which calls `createUser(role: lead)` and stamps the OutreachMessage with `convertedPartyId` + CONVERTED status → the new lead enters the same CRM flow: create Opportunity → work pipeline → Convert to Quote.

No data is duplicated. The same User record for the lead appears in all three packages regardless of which entry point was used.]]></content>

        <content><![CDATA[## Finding Your Way Around

Open the admin app and look at the left-hand navigation. You should see three relevant sections.

### Marketing Section
Navigate to **Marketing** in the sidebar. You will find tabs or menu items for:
- **Content Plans** - this is the default landing screen for the Marketing section
- **Landing Pages** - tap to manage your public capture pages
- **Assessments** - tap to manage questionnaires
- **Personas** - tap to manage ideal customer profiles
- **Social Posts** - tap to see AI-drafted social content

If any of these tabs are missing your administrator needs to add the menu items from the backend menu seed data (widgetNames: ContentPlanList, LandingPageList, AssessmentList, PersonaList, SocialPostList).

### Outreach Section
Navigate to **Outreach** in the sidebar. You will find:
- **Campaigns** - the default screen showing all outreach campaigns
- **Messages** - individual outreach messages across all campaigns
- **Platform Config** - connection settings for email, LinkedIn, and other channels
- **Automation** - the background automation control center

### CRM Section
Navigate to **CRM** (or **Sales**) in the sidebar. You will find:
- **Opportunities** - the pipeline list

### Quick Check
Before continuing, confirm you can open all three sections without a blank screen or error. If you have a problem, enter a message in the chat or report by email at support@groerp.com.]]></content>

        <content><![CDATA[## Creating Your First Persona

A Persona is a semi-fictional representation of your ideal customer. In GrowERP every landing page and course can be linked to a persona so your messaging is always consistent.

### Opening Personas
1. Navigate to **Marketing** in the sidebar
2. Tap the **Personas** tab
3. The persona list screen opens (PersonaList widget)

### Creating a New Persona
1. Tap the **+** floating action button in the bottom right
2. The Persona Detail Screen opens
3. Fill in the fields:
   - **Name** - a memorable label such as &quot;The Overwhelmed Founder&quot; or &quot;The B2B Procurement Manager&quot;
   - **Description** - one paragraph describing who this person is
   - **Pain Points** - bullet the top 3-5 frustrations this persona faces
   - **Goals** - bullet what success looks like for them
   - **Demographics** - industry, company size, job title, location if relevant
4. Tap **Save**

### Using AI Generation
If you are unsure where to start, tap **Generate with AI** on the persona form. Type a one-sentence description such as &quot;A founder of a 5-person SaaS company struggling with customer churn&quot; and tap Generate. The AI will fill in pain points, goals, and a description. Review and edit before saving.

### Best Practices
- Create one persona per distinct audience segment. Most businesses need 2-4 personas.
- Give each persona a human first name in addition to a role label - this makes it easier to refer to them in team conversations.
- Return and update personas quarterly as your understanding of customers deepens.]]></content>

An assessment is a short questionnaire that delivers value to the visitor (they learn something about their business) while capturing their contact details and qualifying them with a score. Leads who score highly are automatically your best prospects.

### Opening Assessments
1. Navigate to **Marketing** then **Assessments**
2. The AssessmentList screen shows all assessments

### Creating an Assessment
1. Tap **+** to open the Assessment Detail Screen
2. Fill in:
   - **Title** - short and outcome-focused, e.g. &quot;Business Operations Health Check&quot;
   - **Description** - what the visitor will learn from completing it
   - **Intro Message** - text shown on the first screen before questions start
   - **Thank You Message** - text shown after submission
   - **Status** - set to ACTIVE to make it live

### Adding Questions
From the Assessment detail screen, tap **Questions** then **+**:
- **Question Text** - the question itself, keep it specific
- **Question Type** - typically MULTIPLE_CHOICE for scored assessments
- **Sequence** - the order questions appear

For each question, tap **Options** to add answer choices:
- **Option Text** - the visible answer text
- **Score** - a numeric value (e.g. 0-10) awarded when the visitor selects this option

### Configuring Scoring Thresholds
Tap **Thresholds** on the assessment to define what a score means:
- **Label** - e.g. &quot;High Priority&quot;, &quot;Medium Priority&quot;, &quot;Low Priority&quot;
- **Min Score / Max Score** - the score range for this bucket
- **Recommendation** - the message shown to the visitor in their results
- **Sequence** - display order

Example setup for a 5-question assessment with max 50 points:
- 40-50: High Priority (hot lead - recommend immediate consultation)
- 25-39: Medium Priority (warm lead - recommend free resource)
- 0-24: Low Priority (nurture with content)

### Viewing Captured Leads
After visitors complete the assessment, tap **Leads** from the Assessment detail screen to see:
- Visitor name and email
- Score achieved
- Threshold bucket they fall into
- Submission date

These leads can be exported or directly linked to an Outreach campaign.]]></content>

        <content><![CDATA[## Content Planning and Social Posts

The Content Plan and Social Post screens help you coordinate the marketing content that drives traffic to your landing pages and keeps your audience engaged between active campaigns.

### Content Plans
A Content Plan is an editorial calendar entry - it describes a content theme, target persona, and time window.

1. Navigate to **Marketing** then **Content Plans**
2. Tap **+** to create a plan:
   - **Title** - theme of the content period, e.g. &quot;Q1 Lead Generation Blitz&quot;
   - **Description** - what topics will be covered and why
   - **Target Persona** - select the persona this content speaks to
   - **Start Date / End Date** - the duration of the plan
3. Tap **Generate with AI** on an existing plan to have the AI suggest a full content calendar with post ideas for the selected persona.

### Social Posts
Social Posts are the individual pieces of content - a LinkedIn article, a tweet thread, an email newsletter etc - linked to a content plan.

1. From within a Content Plan, tap **Social Posts**, or navigate to **Marketing** then **Social Posts**
2. Tap **+** to create a post:
   - **Platform** - select LINKEDIN, TWITTER, EMAIL, MEDIUM, YOUTUBE, SUBSTACK or INAPP
   - **Media Type** - POST, ARTICLE, SEQUENCE, SCRIPT, THREAD, or TUTORIAL
   - **Title** - internal label
   - **Scheduled Date** - when you intend to publish
3. Tap **Draft with AI** to generate the post body. The AI uses the content plan context and target persona to write platform-appropriate copy. Review and edit in the Edited Content field before the generated content is used.

### Status Workflow
Posts move through statuses:
- **DRAFT** - created but not yet reviewed
- **REVIEWED** - approved internally
- **SCHEDULED** - queued for a specific publish date
- **PUBLISHED** - live

Change the status by tapping the status chip on the post detail screen.]]></content>

        <content><![CDATA[## Configuring Your Outreach Platforms

Before you can send any outreach messages you must connect at least one communication platform. GrowERP supports email, LinkedIn, and other channels via a platform adapter system.

### Opening Platform Configurations
1. Navigate to **Outreach** then **Platform Config**
2. The PlatformConfigListScreen shows all configured platforms and their Active status

### Adding an Email Platform
Email is the most reliable starting point.

1. Tap **+** to add a new platform
2. Select **Platform Type: EMAIL**
3. Fill in the SMTP settings from your email provider:
   - **SMTP Host** - e.g. smtp.gmail.com or smtp.office365.com
   - **SMTP Port** - typically 587 (TLS) or 465 (SSL)
   - **Username** - your email address
   - **Password** - your app password (for Gmail: create one in Google Account settings under Security)
   - **From Name** - the sender name recipients will see
   - **From Address** - the reply-to address
4. Toggle **Active** to ON
5. Tap **Save** then use **Test Connection** to verify the settings work

### Adding LinkedIn (requires MCP browser extension)
LinkedIn automation in GrowERP uses a browser extension (the MCP bridge) that controls your LinkedIn session in the browser. This is necessary because LinkedIn does not offer a public API for messaging.

Requirements:
- Install the GrowERP MCP browser extension in your Chrome or Edge browser
- Be logged into LinkedIn in that same browser
- The extension must be running when campaigns execute

Configuration:
1. Tap **+** and select **Platform Type: LINKEDIN**
2. Enter your LinkedIn profile URL
3. Toggle **Active** to ON
4. The extension handles authentication automatically via the browser session

Important: LinkedIn automation must run in a browser window that remains open. Schedule LinkedIn campaigns during business hours when your computer is on.

### Other Platforms

        <content><![CDATA[## Creating an Outreach Campaign

A campaign is a container for a group of leads and the message sequence you intend to send them. One campaign per audience segment and offer keeps things manageable.

### Opening Campaigns
1. Navigate to **Outreach** then **Campaigns**
2. The CampaignListScreen shows all campaigns with their status chips

### Creating a New Campaign
1. Tap **+** to open the Campaign Detail Screen
2. Fill in:
   - **Campaign Name** - a descriptive internal label, e.g. &quot;Q1 High-Score Leads - Email Nurture&quot;
   - **Description** - what this campaign is trying to achieve
   - **Campaign Type** - typically EMAIL_SEQUENCE or LINKEDIN_SEQUENCE
   - **Platform Config** - select the email or LinkedIn config you set up in the previous lesson
   - **Target Persona** - select the persona this campaign targets (optional but recommended)
   - **Landing Page** - if you link a landing page here, GrowERP will automatically enroll leads who complete that page&apos;s assessment into this campaign

### Campaign Statuses
Campaigns move through these statuses:
- **DRAFT** - being configured, not yet running
- **MKTG_CAMP_APPROVED** - approved; the automation service will pick it up and start execution
- **ACTIVE** - currently executing message sequences
- **PAUSED** - temporarily stopped; can be resumed
- **COMPLETED** - all sequences finished

### Adding Leads Manually
From the Campaign Detail Screen you can tap **Add Lead** and search for an existing User to enroll them directly, without requiring them to complete an assessment first.

### Approving a Campaign
When your sequences are ready (next lesson), change the Status to **MKTG_CAMP_APPROVED**. The CampaignAutomationService will detect the status change and begin executing the first step of the sequence for each enrolled lead.]]></content>

        sequenceNum="3">
        <content><![CDATA[## Building a Message Sequence

A message sequence is the series of touchpoints your campaign will execute for each lead. Think of it as a scripted conversation played out automatically over days or weeks.

### Opening Messages
1. From the Campaign Detail Screen, tap **Messages**
2. The OutreachMessageList shows the sequence steps for this campaign

### Adding a Message Step
1. Tap **+** to add a new step
2. Fill in:
   - **Step Number** - the position in the sequence (1, 2, 3...)
   - **Delay Days** - how many days after the previous step before this message sends (use 0 for immediate, 3 for a 3-day gap)
   - **Platform** - select EMAIL or LINKEDIN (must match the campaign&apos;s platform config)
   - **Subject** - email subject line (not used for LinkedIn)
   - **Body** - the message text. Supports template variables (see below)

### Template Variables
The message body supports these placeholders that are replaced with real data when the message sends:
- {{firstName}} - lead&apos;s first name
- {{lastName}} - lead&apos;s last name
- {{companyName}} - lead&apos;s company name
- {{assessmentScore}} - the score from the linked assessment
- {{landingPageUrl}} - the URL of the linked landing page

### A Proven 3-Step Sequence Structure
Step 1 (Day 0) - Personal and short:
&quot;Hi {{firstName}}, I noticed you completed our assessment and scored {{assessmentScore}} out of 50. That puts you in our High Priority group - I&apos;d love to share a quick insight that could help. Is 15 minutes this week possible?&quot;

Step 2 (Day 3) - Value-add follow-up:
Share one specific insight, case study, or resource that is relevant to the lead&apos;s pain points based on their persona. End with a soft question.

Step 3 (Day 7) - Final check-in:
A brief message acknowledging this is your last automated touchpoint and providing a direct calendar link or contact method.

### Editing and Reordering
Tap any message step to edit it. To reorder steps change the Step Number values - the automation service always executes in step number order.

### OutreachMessage Status Lifecycle
Every OutreachMessage — whether created by the automation service for a campaign or by the scraping service for a cold lead — moves through the same status lifecycle:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **PENDING** | Message created and queued; not yet sent |
| **CONTACTED** | The message was sent; awaiting a reply |
| **RESPONDED** | The lead replied or otherwise engaged |
| **CONVERTED** | The lead has been created as a CRM contact (see Lesson 5) |

For automated campaign messages the automation service advances status from PENDING to CONTACTED automatically after delivery. For cold-lead scraping messages you advance status manually as you work through your prospect list. RESPONDED and CONVERTED are always set manually to reflect real-world outcomes.]]></content>

        sequenceNum="4">
        <content><![CDATA[## Automation and Monitoring

Once a campaign is approved the CampaignAutomationService runs in the background. This lesson covers monitoring and controlling that execution.

### The Automation Screen
1. Navigate to **Outreach** then **Automation**
2. The AutomationScreen shows all active campaigns with:
   - Total leads enrolled
   - Messages sent so far
   - Messages pending
   - Any delivery errors

### Campaign Execution Dialog
From the Campaign Detail Screen, tap **Execution** to open the CampaignExecutionDialog. This shows a per-lead breakdown:
- Which step each lead is currently on
- Whether the last message was delivered successfully
- The scheduled date for the next message

### Pausing and Resuming
To temporarily stop a campaign:
1. Open the Campaign Detail Screen
2. Tap **Pause Campaign**
3. Status changes to PAUSED. No new messages will be sent.

To resume:
1. Open the paused campaign
2. Tap **Resume Campaign**
3. Status returns to ACTIVE. Pending messages resume from where they stopped.

### Known Limitation: Landing Page URLs in Emails
If you are running GrowERP on your own domain (not growerp.com), outreach emails that include landing page links will currently use a hardcoded growerp.com base URL. This is a known issue in OutreachServices100.xml line 1016. To fix it, edit that line in the Moqui backend and replace the hardcoded URL with your deployment&apos;s base URL, then restart the server.

### Monitoring Delivery Errors
If a lead shows a delivery error:
- For email: verify the SMTP credentials in Platform Config are still valid (passwords expire)
- For LinkedIn: verify the browser extension is running and you are logged into LinkedIn

Resolve the issue in Platform Config then use the Campaign Execution Dialog to retry the failed step for affected leads.]]></content>

        sequenceNum="5">
        <content><![CDATA[## Cold Lead Scraping: Finding and Converting Prospects

The cold-lead scraping track is fundamentally different from the warm-lead campaign track. Instead of waiting for visitors to find your landing page, the scraping service proactively discovers potential leads from external sources and loads them into the outreach queue as **OutreachMessages**.

### How the Scraping Service Works
The scraping service runs in the background (like the CampaignAutomationService) and discovers prospect data from configured sources. For each prospect found it creates an **OutreachMessage** record with:
- **status: PENDING** — the message has not been sent yet
- The prospect&apos;s available contact information (name, company, email or LinkedIn URL)
- A reference to the campaign or template that defines the initial outreach text

You work this queue manually or in combination with the automation service.

### The Cold Lead Workflow
The lifecycle for each cold prospect follows four stages:

**Stage 1 — PENDING**
The scraper has found the prospect. Review their profile. You can edit the message body to personalise it before sending. When ready, tap **Send** to dispatch the message.

**Stage 2 — CONTACTED**
The message has been sent. The status advances to CONTACTED automatically after delivery (email) or manually (LinkedIn). Note the date. There is nothing more to do until the prospect replies.

**Stage 3 — RESPONDED**
The prospect replied or otherwise engaged (clicked a link, accepted a connection request, attended a call). Update the status to RESPONDED manually to signal that a human conversation has started. Record a note in the message body if needed.

**Stage 4 — CONVERTED**
The prospect is worth bringing into the CRM as a proper lead. Tap the **Convert to Lead** button on the OutreachMessage detail screen. Behind the scenes the system performs two actions:

```
final newUser = await restClient.createUser(
  User(
    role: Role.lead,
    firstName: message.firstName,
    lastName:  message.lastName,
    email:     message.email,
    // ... other available fields
  )
);
await restClient.updateOutreachMessage(
  message.copyWith(
    convertedPartyId: newUser.partyId,
    status: OutreachMessageStatus.converted,
  )
);
```

After conversion the OutreachMessage record shows **CONVERTED** and the new lead&apos;s partyId is stored in `convertedPartyId` for traceability.

### After Conversion: Entering the Standard CRM Flow
Once a cold prospect has been converted to a lead User they are indistinguishable from a warm inbound lead captured via a landing page assessment. From this point the standard flow applies:

1. **Create an Opportunity** — navigate to CRM → Opportunities → + and link the newly created lead User to the opportunity
2. **Work the pipeline** — advance through Prospecting → Qualification → Demo → Proposal → Quote
3. **Convert to Quote** — when the deal is ready tap Convert to Quote on the opportunity to create a sales order in preparation status

### Tips for High-Volume Scraping
- **Filter before sending**: review PENDING messages and delete or skip prospects that clearly do not match your target persona. Quality beats quantity.
- **Personalise step 1**: the scraper provides a template; always edit the first message to include one specific detail about the prospect&apos;s company or role.
- **Batch by campaign**: group scraped prospects into campaigns by industry or persona so you can apply the correct message template and track conversion rates per segment.
- **Track the funnel**: use the Messages list filtered by status to see how many prospects are at each stage. A healthy cold-lead funnel typically has 60–70% at CONTACTED, 15–25% at RESPONDED, and 5–10% CONVERTED.]]></content>

        sequenceNum="1">
        <content><![CDATA[## Creating a Sales Opportunity

An Opportunity is a record for a specific deal with a specific person. It is the handoff point between Outreach (nurturing) and Sales (closing).

### Opening Opportunities
1. Navigate to **CRM** (or **Sales**) then **Opportunities**
2. The OpportunityList screen shows all open deals with their stage, estimated amount, and assigned lead

### When to Create an Opportunity
Create an opportunity when you have had a qualifying conversation (or the Outreach automation has scored the lead highly) and there is a realistic chance of a sale. Do not create opportunities for every lead - only those worth tracking individually.

### Creating a New Opportunity
1. Tap **+** to open the Opportunity Dialog
2. Fill in the required fields:
   - **Name** - a descriptive deal title, e.g. &quot;Greenfield Software: ERP Rollout Q2&quot;
   - **Expected Revenue** - your best estimate of the deal value in your default currency
   - **Expected Probability (%)** - how likely you think this deal is to close (0-100)
   - **Stage** - select Prospecting as the starting point
   - **Next Step** - a note to yourself on the immediate action required
3. Link the people involved:
   - **Lead** - search and select the contact from your lead list (this connects back to the Marketing and Outreach data for this person)
   - **Employee** - search and select the sales rep responsible
4. Tap **Create**

### The ID Field
The system auto-generates a pseudoId (short reference number). You can override this with your own reference code if your organisation uses a deal numbering system.]]></content>

        sequenceNum="2">
        <content><![CDATA[## Working the Opportunity Pipeline

The pipeline stages represent the agreed milestones in your sales process. Moving deals forward deliberately prevents pipeline stagnation.

### The Seven Stages
1. **Prospecting** - you have identified this person as a potential buyer but not yet confirmed their need or budget
2. **Qualification** - you have had an initial conversation and confirmed they have the problem, budget, and authority to buy
3. **Demo/Meeting** - you have delivered a demonstration or discovery meeting and confirmed fit
4. **Proposal** - you have sent a formal written proposal
5. **Quote** - you have sent a specific priced quotation and are awaiting a decision
6. **Closed Won** - the deal is confirmed; move to Convert to Quote to create the order
7. **Closed Lost** - the deal did not proceed; record the reason in the Description field

### Moving a Stage
1. Open the opportunity by tapping its row in the list
2. The Opportunity Dialog opens
3. Change the **Stage** dropdown to the current stage
4. Update **Next Step** to reflect what needs to happen next
5. Tap **Update**

### Tracking a Deal in Practice
After each call or email:
1. Open the opportunity
2. Update **Next Step** immediately while the conversation is fresh
3. Advance the stage if a milestone was reached
4. Update **Probability** upward (or downward) to reflect new information

### Revenue Forecasting
The opportunity list shows the sum of (Expected Revenue x Probability) for all open deals. Keep your probability estimates honest - an inflated pipeline gives management false confidence and leads to under-resourcing of delivery.

### Handling Closed Lost
Do not skip recording Closed Lost deals. Use the Description field to note the reason (e.g. &quot;Lost to competitor on price&quot; or &quot;Budget frozen until next fiscal year&quot;). This data is invaluable for improving your process. The lead contact remains in the system and can be enrolled in an Outreach campaign to nurture for future opportunities.]]></content>

        <content><![CDATA[## Converting an Opportunity to a Quote

When a deal reaches the point where you need to send a formal priced quotation, use Convert to Quote to create a sales order in one click.

### What Convert to Quote Does
Tapping the button performs two actions simultaneously:
1. Creates a new sales order (FinDoc type Order, sales=true) in Preparation status, with the lead contact pre-filled from the opportunity
2. Updates the opportunity stage from its current value to &quot;Quote&quot;

The order starts in Preparation status so your finance or operations team can add line items and review before sending to the customer.

### How to Convert
1. Open the opportunity by tapping its row in the OpportunityList
2. The Opportunity Dialog opens
3. Scroll to the bottom - you will see a blue **Convert to Quote** button (only visible on existing opportunities, not on the new opportunity form)
4. Tap it
5. A green confirmation message appears: &quot;Quote #[pseudoId] created successfully&quot;
6. The dialog closes and the opportunity stage is now &quot;Quote&quot;

### Finding the Created Order
The new order lives in the Orders section:
1. Navigate to **Orders** (under the Order/Accounting module)
2. Filter by Sales = true and Status = Preparation
3. Find the order matching the pseudoId from the confirmation message
4. Open it to add:
   - **Line items** - products or services from your catalog
   - **Quantities and prices**
   - **Shipping method** if applicable

### Order Status Progression
After adding line items:
1. Change status to **Created** when the quote is ready to send
2. Send the quote document to the customer (use the Print/PDF option)
3. When the customer accepts, change status to **Approved**
4. When fulfilled, change to **Completed**

### If the Deal is Lost After Quoting
Return to the opportunity and change the stage to **Closed Lost**. The order in Preparation status should be cancelled (change its status to Cancelled in the Orders section) to keep your books clean.]]></content>
