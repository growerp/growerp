# Melos Configuration Fix - No More Package Selection Prompts ✅

## Problem
All melos scripts (build, l10n, test, etc.) were prompting for package selection, requiring the `--no-select` flag.

## Root Cause
The scripts were using the **incorrect syntax** with `run:` at the top level combined with `exec:` nested underneath. This dual structure causes Melos to prompt for package selection.

## Solution
Changed from `run:` + nested `exec:` structure to using `exec:` directly at the top level.

## Changes Made

### ❌ Old Pattern (Prompted for Selection)
```yaml
build:
  description: build_runner build all modules.
  run: "dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs"
  exec:
    concurrency: 1
    orderDependents: true
  packageFilters:
    dependsOn: build_runner
```

### ✅ New Pattern (Automatic Selection)
```yaml
build:
  description: build_runner build all modules.
  exec: dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
  concurrency: 1
  orderDependents: true
  packageFilters:
    dependsOn: build_runner
```

## Updated Scripts

All the following scripts were updated to use the correct pattern:

1. ✅ **build** - Now auto-selects packages with build_runner
2. ✅ **buildclean** - Now auto-selects packages with build_runner
3. ✅ **watch** - Now auto-selects packages with build_runner
4. ✅ **l10n** - Now auto-selects packages with l10n.yaml
5. ✅ **test_package** - Now auto-selects example packages with integration_test
6. ✅ **test** - Now auto-selects all packages with integration_test
7. ✅ **test-headless** - Now auto-selects all packages with integration_test

## Key Differences

### `run:` vs `exec:`

- **`run:`** - Executes a single command in the Melos workspace root (prompts for selection if used with exec)
- **`exec:`** - Executes a command in each selected package directory (auto-selects based on filters)

### Correct Usage Pattern

**For commands that run in each package:**
```yaml
script_name:
  exec: command to run
  concurrency: 1
  packageFilters:
    # filters here
```

**For commands that run once in workspace root:**
```yaml
script_name:
  run: command to run
  # No exec or packageFilters needed
```

## Testing

Now all commands work without `--no-select`:

```bash
# All of these now work without prompts!
melos build
melos l10n
melos test
melos watch
melos buildclean
```

## How Package Selection Works Now

Each script automatically selects packages based on its `packageFilters`:

- **build/buildclean/watch**: Packages with `build_runner` dependency
- **l10n**: Packages with `l10n.yaml` file
- **test**: Packages with `integration_test` directory
- **test_package**: Example packages with `integration_test` directory

## Documentation

From Melos documentation:
- Use `exec:` when you want to run a command in multiple packages
- Use `run:` when you want to run a command once in the workspace root
- Don't mix `run:` and `exec:` - choose one or the other
