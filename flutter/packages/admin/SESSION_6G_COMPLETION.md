## Task 1: Fix Retrofit API Client Compilation Error ✅

### Problem
The assessment API client had a Retrofit code generation error:
```
OR: ../growerp_assessment/lib/src/api/assessment_api_client.g.dart:94:31
Error: The method 'fromJson' isn't defined for the type 'Type'.
ERROR: Try correcting the name to the name of an existing method, or 
defining a method named 'fromJson'.
ERROR: MapEntry(k, dynamic.fromJson(v as Map<String, dynamic>)));
```

### Root Cause
Using `Map<String, dynamic>` as a return type in Retrofit methods caused the code generator to try calling `dynamic.fromJson()`, which doesn't exist. Retrofit doesn't know how to deserialize dynamic values in maps.

### Solution
Changed 7 API methods from returning `Map<String, dynamic>` to returning `dynamic`:

**Methods Updated** (assessment_api_client.dart):
1. `listAssessments()` - Line 27
2. `listQuestions()` - Line 86
3. `listOptions()` - Line 123
4. `getThresholds()` - Line 134
5. `updateThresholds()` - Line 140
6. `calculateScore()` - Line 147
7. `listResults()` - Line 156

### Implementation Details
```dart
// BEFORE (Retrofit generation error)
Future<Map<String, dynamic>> listAssessments({...});

// AFTER (Retrofit handles properly)
Future<dynamic> listAssessments({...});
```

The repository layer already handles parsing the dynamic response:
```dart
final response = await apiClient.listAssessments(...);
final dataList = (response['data'] as List?)?.cast<Map<String, dynamic>>() ?? [];
final total = (response['total'] as num?)?.toInt() ?? 0;
```

### Verification
✅ Build Success:
```
cd /home/hans/growerp/flutter/packages/growerp_assessment
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
✅ Succeeded after 132ms with 0 outputs
```

## Task 2: Add Assessment REST Endpoints to Moqui ✅

### File Modified
`/home/hans/growerp/moqui/runtime/component/growerp/service/growerp.rest.xml`

### Endpoints Added
Comprehensive REST API structure for assessment operations:

```
Assessment Management:
  GET    /rest/s1/growerp/100/Assessment
  POST   /rest/s1/growerp/100/Assessment
  PATCH  /rest/s1/growerp/100/Assessment
  DELETE /rest/s1/growerp/100/Assessment

Questions (nested):
  GET    /rest/s1/growerp/100/Assessment/{assessmentId}/Question
  POST   /rest/s1/growerp/100/Assessment/{assessmentId}/Question
  PATCH  /rest/s1/growerp/100/Assessment/{assessmentId}/Question
  DELETE /rest/s1/growerp/100/Assessment/{assessmentId}/Question

Options (nested):
  GET    /rest/s1/growerp/100/Assessment/{assessmentId}/Question/{questionId}/Option
  POST   /rest/s1/growerp/100/Assessment/{assessmentId}/Question/{questionId}/Option
  PATCH  /rest/s1/growerp/100/Assessment/{assessmentId}/Question/{questionId}/Option
  DELETE /rest/s1/growerp/100/Assessment/{assessmentId}/Question/{questionId}/Option

Thresholds:
  GET    /rest/s1/growerp/100/Assessment/{assessmentId}/Threshold
  PATCH  /rest/s1/growerp/100/Assessment/{assessmentId}/Threshold

Score Calculation:
  POST   /rest/s1/growerp/100/Assessment/{assessmentId}/CalculateScore

Results:
  GET    /rest/s1/growerp/100/Assessment/{assessmentId}/Result
  POST   /rest/s1/growerp/100/Assessment/{assessmentId}/Result
  DELETE /rest/s1/growerp/100/Assessment/{assessmentId}/Result
```

### Service Mappings
All endpoints map to services in `AssessmentServices100`:
- `growerp.100.AssessmentServices100.get#Assessment`
- `growerp.100.AssessmentServices100.create#Assessment`
- `growerp.100.AssessmentServices100.update#Assessment`
- `growerp.100.AssessmentServices100.delete#Assessment`
- `growerp.100.AssessmentServices100.get#Question`
- `growerp.100.AssessmentServices100.create#Question`
- `growerp.100.AssessmentServices100.update#Question`
- `growerp.100.AssessmentServices100.delete#Question`
- `growerp.100.AssessmentServices100.get#Option`
- `growerp.100.AssessmentServices100.create#Option`
- `growerp.100.AssessmentServices100.update#Option`
- `growerp.100.AssessmentServices100.delete#Option`
- `growerp.100.AssessmentServices100.get#Threshold`
- `growerp.100.AssessmentServices100.update#Threshold`
- `growerp.100.AssessmentServices100.calculate#Score`
- `growerp.100.AssessmentServices100.get#Result`
- `growerp.100.AssessmentServices100.create#Result`
- `growerp.100.AssessmentServices100.delete#Result`

## Technical Details

### Why Retrofit Failed
The Retrofit code generator in Dart is strictly typed. When you specify `Future<Map<String, dynamic>>`:
1. It generates code to deserialize the response
2. It tries to call `.fromJson()` on each value in the map
3. Since values are `dynamic`, there's no `.fromJson()` method
4. Compilation error occurs

### Why `dynamic` Works
When you specify `Future<dynamic>`:
1. Retrofit returns the raw response without type-checking
2. The repository layer safely casts and processes the response
3. No compilation error because no type safety is promised

### GrowERP Pattern
This follows the existing pattern in growerp_models where complex responses are returned as `dynamic` and handled by repository layers:
- Provides flexibility
- Type safety at repository level
- Clean separation of concerns

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Required for UAT)
1. **Create backend service definitions** (Moqui)
   - File: `moqui/runtime/component/growerp/service/AssessmentServices.xml`
   - Implement: 18 service methods for assessment operations
   - Status: TODO

2. **Database schema** (if needed)
   - Assessment entities in Moqui
   - Question entities
   - Option entities
   - Result entities
   - Status: TODO

3. **Manual UAT testing**
   - Run 8 manual test cases
   - Verify all flows work
   - Test error handling
   - Status: READY

### Post-UAT (Production)
1. Deploy changes to master
2. Run full integration test suite
3. Performance monitoring
4. Collect user feedback
