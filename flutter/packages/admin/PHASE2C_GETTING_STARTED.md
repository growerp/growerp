### Test 6: Responsive Design (Tablet) âœ“
**Objective**: Verify assessment works on tablet devices

**Steps**:
1. Set emulator to tablet dimensions (1024x1366)
2. Access Assessment menu
3. Complete full assessment flow
4. Verify:
   - Layout uses available space
   - No excessive whitespace
   - Text remains readable
   - Touch targets appropriately sized

**Expected Result**: Optimized layout for tablet

**Status**: Ready for execution

---

### Test 7: Error Handling âœ“
**Objective**: Test various error scenarios

**Test 7a: Network Error**:
1. Disconnect emulator from network
2. Try to submit assessment
3. Verify error message displayed
4. Verify option to retry

**Test 7b: Validation Error**:
1. Try to submit form with empty required fields
2. Verify validation errors shown
3. Verify form not submitted

**Test 7c: API Error**:
1. Mock backend error (500)
2. Try to load assessment
3. Verify graceful error handling
4. Verify user feedback message

**Expected Result**: All errors handled gracefully with user feedback

**Status**: Ready for execution

---

### Test 8: Performance âœ“
**Objective**: Measure performance metrics

**Steps**:
1. Measure initial load time:
   - From menu selection to Assessment loaded
   - Target: < 500ms

2. Measure flow completion time:
   - From form start to submission
   - Target: < 2s (network dependent)

3. Monitor memory usage:
   - Check for memory leaks
   - Monitor during flow completion
   - Check after navigation away

4. Check build size:
   - Measure apk/ipa size increase
   - Expected: ~50KB

**Expected Result**:
- Load times acceptable
- No memory leaks
- App size acceptable

**Status**: Ready for execution

## Testing Environment Setup

### Emulator Configuration
```bash
# For mobile testing (375x812)
flutter run -d emulator-5554

# For tablet testing (1024x1366)
flutter run -d emulator-5554 --device-id=tablet

# Check device specs
flutter devices
```

### Test Data
Pre-configure test users:
- Name: "Test Admin"
- Email: "admin@test.com"
- Company: "Test Company"

### Logging
Enable debug logging:
```dart
// In assessment_bloc.dart
logger.d('Event: $event');
logger.d('State: $state');
```

---

## Known Issues to Watch For

### 1. Menu Index Alignment
- Assessment is at menuIndex: 6
- If menu structure changes, must be updated
- Current order: Dashboard, Companies, CRM, Catalog, Orders, Inventory, **Assessment**, Accounting, About

### 2. Assessment ID Generation
- Currently uses timestamp: `assessment_${DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch}`
- Backend may provide different ID format
- May need adjustment based on backend API

### 3. Results Placeholder
- Shows "No Results Available" until AssessmentSubmitted event
- May need to show historical results from backend
- Phase 2c future enhancement

### 4. Wrapper State Management
- AssessmentFlowWrapper and AssessmentResultsWrapper are stateful
- State is local to component
- Doesn't persist across navigation away/back
