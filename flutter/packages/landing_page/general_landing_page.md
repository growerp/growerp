This is a template for a general readiness assessment landing page, designed strictly according to the structure and components described for creating a successful lead-generating online assessment.

The goal of this assessment is to generate leads by asking users to answer a series of questions, resulting in **dynamic results** and tailored next steps.

***

## Business Readiness Assessment Landing Page

### 1. The Hook (Top of the Landing Page)

The first thing people see when scrolling is the hook. We will use the **Results Hook** format, which uses a readiness sentence to make people question if they are prepared for the desired outcome.

| Component | Content (Example Focus) | Source Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hook (Results Hook)** | **Are you ready to unlock your business's full potential?** | (Are you ready to achieve X result?) |

### 2. The Subheading

The subheading directs people to take the assessment by answering a number of questions so they can find out if they are ready or how to deal with their frustration.

| Component | Content (Example Focus) | Source Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Subheading** | **Answer a few questions to find out why you might be facing challenges and what steps you need to take to guarantee success.** | (Answer 15 questions to find out why youâ€™re experiencing this frustration and what to do about it.) |

### 3. The Value Proposition

The value proposition tells people they should take the assessment so that we can **measure and improve three key areas**. These three areas should be things the user would love to achieve along the way to a better result.

| Component | Content (Example Focus) | Source Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Value Proposition** | Take this assessment so that we can measure and improve three key areas essential for successful business transformation: | |
| **Three Key Areas** | 1. **Foundational Pillar 1 (e.g., Operational Efficiency)** | |
| | 2. **Foundational Pillar 2 (e.g., Customer Engagement)** | |
| | 3. **Foundational Pillar 3 (e.g., Scalable Growth)** | |

### 4. Credibility Section

After hearing a powerful hook and value proposition, users immediately want to know if it is credible. This section must address: who created it, their background, and the research they have done.

| Component | Content (Example Focus) | Source Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Credibility** | **Who Created This?** This assessment was created by [Your Name/Company], a team specialized in scaling businesses and optimizing systems. | (Who created this, which is you and your bio) |
| | **Background:** Our background involves two decades of scaling multiple companies and building lead generation systems. We have consulted on over 50 major projects across various industries. | (What's your background?) |
| | **Research & Statistics:** We leveraged global data showing that 85% of businesses struggle with [Common Problem] during large projects, leading to project delays. Furthermore, a recent study found that organizations prioritizing [Key Success Factor] are 3X more likely to achieve project ROI. This assessment identifies where you stand. | (Quote statistics/figures; mention research done) |

### 5. Call to Action (CTA)

The final section is the powerful call to action (CTA). It must clearly state the next step, the required time commitment, the cost (free), and the benefit (immediate recommendations).

| Component | Content (Example Focus) | Source Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Powerful Call to Action** | **Start the Readiness Quiz Now!** | (Say "Start the quiz") |
| **Time/Cost/Benefit** | **It only takes 3 minutes to complete. It's completely free, and you get immediate, tailored recommendations on how you can improve your readiness score.** | (Takes 3 minutes, completely free, immediate recommendations on how to improve) |

### Assessment Structure (Behind the Landing Page)

While the landing page generates the interest, the assessment itself would consist of a number of questions structured in three parts:

1.  **Contact Information (Mandatory/Optional):** Capturing the user's name and email address is mandatory to start the quiz. Location will be captured via IP address, and the phone number is optional.
2.  **Best Practices Questions (10 Questions):** These questions measure whether the user is doing the things they should be doing (e.g., related to industry best practices). The answers to these questions inform their final score.
3.  **Qualifying Questions (5 Questions):** These "Big Five" questions are crucial for qualifying the lead and making sales.

| Question Type | Purpose (Example Focus) | Source Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. Current Situation | Which best describes your current situation (e.g., Stagnant, Slow Growth, Rapid Growth)? | (Which best describes your current situation?) |
| 2. Desired Outcome | Which desired outcome would you like to achieve in the next 90 days (e.g., Increase revenue, Improve customer satisfaction, Streamline operations)? | (Desired outcome in the next 90 days) |
| 3. Obstacle | What is the biggest obstacle stopping you, or what have you tried that hasn't worked (e.g., Inefficient workflows, Lack of market visibility, Outdated technology)? | (What is the obstacle stopping you or what have you tried that hasn't worked?) |
| 4. Solution Preference | Which solution do you think would suit you best (e.g., Education/Training, One-to-one consulting/coaching, Full implementation support, Software recommendation)? (This implies budget level.) | (Which solution do you think would suit you best?) |
| 5. Open Box | Is there anything else that you think we need to know about? (Allows users to reveal budget constraints or specific urgency.) | (Open box question for useful information that helps make a sale) |
