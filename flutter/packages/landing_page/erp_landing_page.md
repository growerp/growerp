### **(Results Page)**

**Thank You! We've Calculated Your Results.**

Your "ERP Readiness Score" is: **[Score]%**

*(This score is based on your answers related to system gaps, manual workload, and data visibility.)*

**Based on your score, here is our recommendation:**

**(Display a dynamic message based on their score. For example:)**

> **High Score (80-100%): You are an ideal candidate for a rapid implementation.** Your operations are suffering from significant manual work and data silos. You would see an immediate ROI from a modern, integrated system. The modules you selected (e.g., Inventory, Accounting) are core to our fixed-fee package.
>
> **Medium Score (50-79%): You are on the right track but facing key bottlenecks.** You have some systems in place, but they are disconnected. A modular ERP would allow you to replace the most painful parts of your process first (like inventory) and integrate the rest, saving you time and money.
>
> **Low Score (0-49%): You are in the early planning stages.** You may still be defining your processes. Your immediate next step should be to clearly map out your primary workflows to see how a central system could help you scale.
