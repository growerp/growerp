## Integration with Main App

To integrate this example into the admin or other apps:

```dart
// In admin/lib/main.dart
extraBlocProviders: [
  ...getCoreBlocProviders(restClient),
  ...getAssessmentBlocProviders(restClient),  // ← Add this
  // ... other providers
]

// Add to menu options
MenuOption(
  title: 'Assessment',
  route: '/assessment',
  tabItems: [
    TabItem(form: const AssessmentListScreen(), label: 'Assessments'),
    TabItem(form: const AssessmentResultsListScreen(), label: 'Results'),
  ],
)
```

## Next Steps
