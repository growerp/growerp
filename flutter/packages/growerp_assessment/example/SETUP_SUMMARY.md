# Assessment Package Example App Setup Summary

## Overview

A complete example Flutter application has been created to showcase the `growerp_assessment` package functionality. This example demonstrates best practices for integrating the assessment package into a GrowERP application.

## Key Features

### 1. Application Structure (`main.dart`)
- **TopApp Setup**: Configured with:
  - RestClient for API communication
  - BLoC observer for debugging
  - WebSocket clients for chat/notifications
  - Assessment BLoC providers
  
- **Navigation System**:
  - Menu-based routing with 3 main sections
  - Dashboard showing company and assessment metrics
  - Assessment management screens
  - Results analysis screens

- **Menu Options**:
  1. **Main** - Dashboard with key metrics
  2. **Organization** - Company information
  3. **Assessment** - Assessment management and results
     - Assessments tab
     - Results tab

### 2. Configuration (`app_settings.json`)
- Backend URL configuration
- Chat WebSocket URL
- Connection timeouts (development and production)
- Request/response logging options
- Support for single-company or multi-company modes

### 3. Demo Screens
- **MainMenu**: Dashboard displaying:
  - Company information (name, email, currency, employees)
  - Lead and customer counts
  - Product inventory stats

- **AssessmentListScreen**: Placeholder for assessment management
  - Button to create new assessments
  - Space for assessment listings

- **AssessmentResultsListScreen**: Placeholder for results display
  - Results analysis view
  - Export/sharing capabilities

### 4. Integration Tests
- Basic smoke test structure
- Ready for expansion with actual test cases
- Test driver configuration for CI/CD integration

## Usage Instructions

### Getting Started
```bash
# Navigate to example directory
cd flutter/packages/growerp_assessment/example

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Generate code
flutter pub run build_runner build

# Run on development device
flutter run
```

### Configuration
Edit `assets/cfg/app_settings.json`:
```json
{
    "databaseUrl": "https://your-backend.com",
    "chatUrl": "wss://your-chat-server.com"
}
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Integration tests
flutter test integration_test/assessment_test.dart

# Using Docker (CI/CD)
./flutter/build_run_all_tests.sh
```

## Integration Points

### BLoC State Management
The app uses GrowERP's BLoC architecture:
- `AuthBloc` for authentication
- `AssessmentBloc` for assessment operations
- `ChatBloc` for real-time messaging
- `ThemeBloc` for theming
- `LocaleBloc` for localization

### API Communication
Type-safe REST client using Retrofit:
- Assessment CRUD operations
- Question management
- Result submission and scoring
- Multi-tenant support

### Multi-tenancy
- Tenant isolation via `ownerPartyId`
- Support for dual-ID strategy (systemId / pseudoId)
- Company switching capability

## Extending the Example

### Adding New Features
1. Create new screens in `lib/`
2. Add to menu options in `main.dart`
3. Update route generation in `generateRoute()`
4. Add integration tests

### Customizing Dashboard
- Edit the `MainMenu` widget
- Modify dashboard metrics
- Add custom statistics

### Adding More Screens
Example menu structure for additional features:
```dart
MenuOption(
  title: 'Reports',
  route: '/reports',
  tabItems: [
    TabItem(label: 'Analytics', form: AnalyticsScreen()),
    TabItem(label: 'Export', form: ExportScreen()),
  ],
)
```

## Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Package Organization**: Proper use of pubspec.yaml with local path dependencies
2. **Asset Management**: Configuration files in dedicated assets/cfg/ directory
3. **State Management**: BLoC pattern implementation with proper provider setup
4. **Testing**: Integration test structure following GrowERP conventions
5. **Routing**: Menu-driven navigation with dynamic route generation
6. **Localization**: Support for multiple languages and locales
7. **Error Handling**: Centralized error management through BLoCs

## Common Tasks

### Debugging API Calls
Enable logging in `app_settings.json`:
```json
{
    "restRequestLogs": true,
    "restResponseLogs": true
}
```

### Building for Different Platforms
```bash
# Android
flutter build apk

# iOS
flutter build ios

# Web
flutter build web

# Linux
flutter build linux

# Windows
flutter build windows
```

### Running Headless Tests
```bash
./flutter/build_run_all_tests.sh
```
